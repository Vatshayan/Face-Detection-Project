### Abstract: 
This research paper gives an ideal way of detecting and recognizing human face using OpenCV, and python which is part of Machine learning. This report contains the ways in which Machine learning an important part of computer science field can be used to determine the face using several libraries in OpenCV along with python. This System will contain a proposed system which will help in the detecting the human face in real time. This implementation can be used at various platforms in machines and smartphones, and several software applications.
